Our api url is https://api.iscs.io

All requests need to include a header, ISCS_API_KEY set to your api key (below)

In order to login and eventually fetch the list of policies, you’ll first do a GET on /api/v2/crestbrook-ceg.
You’ll then POST your login credentials to the appropriate endpoint.  That post will look something like:
Host: api.iscs.io
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 36
Cache-Control: no-cache
ISCS_API_KEY: 49ykt9wggfer9cckndfaj2dh
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_2) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.111 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8

{"username":"ryan",
"password":"pw”}

Upon successful login, the response will include a bearerToken which will need to be supplied in the header of all subsequent requests.

In that same response, you should find enough info to then be able to get the customer details, which should lead you to find the policies list.

Your username/password is ryan/pw
Your api key is : 49ykt9wggfer9cckndfaj2dh

We’d like you to give us a small angular/bootstrap project that, upon successful login, lists the policies you find.  If you have questions, feel free to ask…we like questions.  :-)
